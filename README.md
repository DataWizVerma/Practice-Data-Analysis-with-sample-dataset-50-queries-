# SQL Practice Project

This project demonstrates SQL query techniques for handling business questions and analyzing data effectively. It includes practical examples with a sample dataset, covering essential SQL functions and statements. Through this practice, I aimed to solidify my understanding of fundamental SQL queries and build proficiency in complex query structures.

## Project Overview

In this project, I worked with a sample dataset to practice and clarify SQL concepts, including:

- **Basic SQL Queries:** Using the `SELECT` statement to extract data for business analysis.
- **Filtering Data:** Leveraging the `WHERE` clause and combining `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators to create complex filtering conditions.
- **Sorting Data:** Organizing query results with `ORDER BY` for better data interpretation.
- **Joining Tables:** Combining data from multiple tables using `JOIN` statements to generate comprehensive insights.
- **Grouping and Aggregating Data:** Using `GROUP BY` to create reports and aggregate data for summary analysis.

This practice covers more than 50 example queries, with tips and techniques for applying SQL to common data analysis tasks.
